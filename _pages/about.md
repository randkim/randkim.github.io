Hello & Welcome!
======
As a PhD student, I have found myself reading countless papers; analysing them and deriving the equations presented with a considerble amount of time and effort spent. Unfortunately, most of the work ends up helping no one else, with few opportunities to share and my derivations gradually getting lost in the stack of papers that ends up getting recyled. 

The main intention of this blog is to keep a record of all the hard work that I have put into studying papers. My aim is to write comprehensive and detailed articles that I can refer to back in the future. If the blog gets larger and people start following along, I hope it helps other academics to understand these papers as well. More than anything, I'm looking forward to the day where I can discuss and listen to other people's approach and understanding of papers.

Sometimes I will post random thoughts that come to mind as well. Some of them will be science-related (mostly Physics but also potentially a healthy amount of biology and economics), and some more philosophical. Here and there, I will post book review as I finish reaading them.
