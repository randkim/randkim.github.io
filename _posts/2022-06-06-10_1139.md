The two-level system and the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) were one of the first things I learnt during my undergraduate Quantum Mechanics course. However, there is a seemingly paradoxical effect that results from the combination of these concepts: the light, or ac Stark shift. Before studying the paper in depth, let us first review why this is paradoxical.

The Hamiltonian related to the ac Stark shift for a two-level system is given by the following (refer back to an atomic physics textbook if you don't recall where this came from):
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_{eff} = -\frac{\hbar \Omega^2}{4\Delta} \bigg[\ket{2}\bra{2} - \ket{1}\bra{1} \bigg]
\end{equation}
Where $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency and $\Delta$ is the detuning from resonance. We can see that the magnitude of the ac Stark shift increases as \$\Omega/\Delta \gg 1\$.
